# Trailheads-Up
Trailheads-Up is a web app and a data pipeline that gives hikers and trail managers real-time forecasts of trailhead popularity. The app uses the computer vision model yolo3 to count cars in webcam images of the parking lots. 

Trailheads-Up was prototyped on the [Spokane County Parks and Recreation](https://www.spokanecounty.org/4214/Trailhead-Web-Cams) trail system who currently has webcams on 5 trailhead parking lots.
